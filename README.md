# Solvation Meta Predictor

This repository contains code for predicting the aqueous solubility of organic molecules using machine learning models. The models and dataset are based on the research paper: [Predicting Aqueous Solubility of Organic Molecules Using Deep Learning Models with Varied Molecular Representations](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.2c00642).

## Usage

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
patch <input_file> <patches/input_file.patchfile>
cd pnnlsolpaper/data
python ./create_data.py
```

1. **Download Data**: Download the dataset from [this link](https://figshare.com/s/542fb80e65742746603c) and save it as `data.csv` in the `./data` folder.

2. **Generate Features**:
    - Generate Pybel coordinates and Molecular Dynamics (MDM) features by running `create_data.py` in the `./data` folder:
      ```sh
      cd ./data
      python create_data.py
      ```

3. **Train Models**:
    - To train the MDM model, run `train.py` in the `./mdm` folder:
      ```sh
      cd ../mdm
      python train.py
      ```
    - To train the GNN model, run `train.py` in the `./gnn` folder:
      ```sh
      cd ../gnn
      python train.py
      ```
    - To train the SMI model, run `train.py` in the `./smi` folder:
      ```sh
      cd ../smi
      python train.py
      ```

4. **Make Predictions**:
    - Use the `predict.ipynb` files in each model's folder to make predictions:
      ```sh
      cd ../mdm
      jupyter notebook predict.ipynb
      ```
      Repeat the above steps for the `gnn` and `smi` folders.

5. **Ensemble Models**:
    - To ensemble the models, run the following scripts:
      ```sh
      cd ../ensemble
      python CV.py
      python Optuna.py
      python KNN.py
      ```

6. **Compare Predictions**:
    - To compare predictions from individual models with ensemble methods, use the `ensemble_prediction.ipynb` notebook:
      ```sh
      jupyter notebook ensemble_prediction.ipynb
      ```
